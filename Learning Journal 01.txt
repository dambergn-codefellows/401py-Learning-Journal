Learning Journal 01
Today I learned that at times I can make problems more complicated than they really are because I consider how they may be expanded upon beyond the scope of the requirements. In the end I completed Lab01 adding an un-requested feature and over complicated the dictionary to store item data and prices to print out a total receipt. In the end I figured out how to navigate the dictionary properly but may have completed it sooner otherwise.
