Learning Journal 01
Today I learned that at times I can make problems more complicated than they really are because I consider how they may be expanded upon beyon the scope of the requirements.  In the end I completed Lab01 adding an unrequested feature and over complicated the dictonary to store item data and prices to print out a total recipt.  In the end I figured out how to navigate the dictonary properly but may have completed it sooner otherwise.
